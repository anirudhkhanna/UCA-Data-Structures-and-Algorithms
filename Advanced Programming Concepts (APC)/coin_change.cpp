/* Coin Change Problem:
   Given a set of coin denominations and a total amount, find out in how many ways the change for that amount can be made using the denominations given.
   
   Example: Amount = 5
            Coins[] = {1, 2, 3}
            
            Number of ways = 5
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, {2, 3}
   
   Recursive Approach:
   For every coin, we have the option to either include it in the soluÂ­tion or to exclude it.
   When a coin is included, the amount should be decreased by the coin's value. When it is excluded, we should try the same for the next coin, with the same amount.
   
   Complexity:
   O(2^n) (This can be reduced by Dynamic Programming)
